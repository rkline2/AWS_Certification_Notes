## What is Cloud Computing?

### Cloud Computing

The "text-book" definition of Cloud Computing:

* Cloud Computing is the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than on a local server or personal computer.

* Cloud computing allows companies or individuals to rent the resources they need for their companies or personal projects like storage space.

* Companies no longer have to purchase physical hardware with expensive IT departments.

* This has helped a lot of smaller companies launch their projects or services quickly.

* Companies can adjust the types of services they need on demand instead of waiting weeks or longer for new servers or other equipment to scale their businesses.

* Individuals no longer need a computer with a huge hard drive for photos or files. They can now store these on services like Google Drive.

### On-premise vs Cloud Providers

On-premise

* You own the servers
* You hire the IT people
* You pay or rent the real-estate
* You take all the risk. 

Cloud Providers

* Someone else owns the servers
* Someone else hires the IT people
* Someone else pays or rents the real-estate
* You are responsible for configuring your cloud services and code, someone else takes care of the rest

## The Evolution of Cloud Hosting

### Types of Hosting

**Dedicated Server** - One physical machine dedicated to single a business

* Runs a single web-app/site.
* Very Expensive, High Maintenance, *High Security

**Virtual Private Server** - The physical machine is virtualized into sub-machines

* Runs multiple web-apps/sites
* Better Utilization and Isolation of Resources

**Shared Hosting** - One physical machine, shared by hundred of businesses

* Relies on most tenants under-utilizing their resources.
* Very Cheap, Limited functionality, Poor Isolation

**Cloud Hosting** - Multiple physical machines that act as one system

* The system is abstracted into multiple cloud services
* Flexible, Scalable, Secure, Cost-Effective, High Configurability

## Technology Overview

Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) that are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) will always have 4 core cloud service offerings:

* **Compute** - EC2 Virtual Machines
* **Storage** - EBS Virtual Hard drives
* **Database** - RDS SQL databases
* **Networking and Content Delivery** - VPC Private Cloud Network

## Types of Cloud Computing

### Cloud Computing models

There are three main models of Cloud Computing:

1. SaaS - Software as a Service
2. PaaS- Platform as a Service
3. IaaS- Infrastructure as a Service 

### IaaS- Infrastructure as a Service (Host)

    Most basic building blocks of cloud IT infrastructure. It has the most flexibility and management control of all the different cloud computing models. It is the closest to having a traditional on-premises data center.

Examples:

* Amazon Web Services
* Microsoft Azure
* Google Cloud 

### PaaS- Platform as a Service (Build)

    Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app. Less flexibility than IaaS because of pre-constructed packages.

Examples:

* AWS Elastic Beanstalk
* Windows Azure
* Heroku
* Google App Engine 

### SaaS- Software as a Service (Consume)

    Completed projects managed by a service provider. Easy to use and comes complete with a user interface. Least flexibility

Examples:

* Gmail
* Adobe Creative Cloud

## Cloud Computing Deployment Models

There are three different types of deployment models for Cloud Computing.

### 1. Cloud

When you think of Cloud, think of small startups.

**Cloud Deployment:** 

* 100% of IT infrastructure is on the cloud.
* All of a companies applications were migrated to or created on the cloud.
* Helps to remove roadblocks of costly and time consuming procurement processes for on-premises infrastructure (big servers and data centers!).
* Great for small businesses and start-ups. 

### 2. Hybrid

When you think of Hybrid, think of Fin Tech Companies

**Hybrid Deployment:**

* Connects on-premises technology with cloud-based resources
* Great for established companies that had a dedicated data center but also wants to migrate processes over to the cloud
* Data is partially on the cloud, and partially in the on-premises
* Popular in the Fin Tech space 

### 3. On-Premise

When you think of On-premise, think of large old companies or companies that are beholden to Government Regulations.

**On-premises(Private cloud) Deployment:**

* Use virtualization to deploy resources in their on-premises data centers.
* Resembles traditional IT infrastructure with big servers, data centers, etc.
* Do not get the same benefits of cloud computing (ability to easily scale up and down on demand)
* Company has dedicated resources that are not shared with others(good for security)
* Resources cannot be accessed using the internet
* Typically older large companies or owned by Government organizations
